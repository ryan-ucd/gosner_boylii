# The Gosner Staging App

This is a shiny app to display Gosner (1960) stages for Foothill yellow-legged frog (*Rana boylii*) development from eggs to metamorphosed young-of-year.

I don't have photos for all stages yet, but will keep updating as they come. 

## Select a Stage

Select or Type in a Gosner Number and the associated photo and gosner stage should appear when available.
